# Scalping Tracker Integration - Quick Setup

## New Feature Added! ðŸš€

A **Scalping Entry Tracker** has been integrated as a third tab in your Dr. Paul ETH Trading System. This complements Dr. Paul's longer-term methodology with fast scalping signals.

### How to Access

1. Start your dashboard:
   ```bash
   cd dashboard
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open http://localhost:3000

3. Click the **"Scalping Tracker"** tab (âš¡ icon)

### Features

- **Real-time signals** based on 9 EMA, 21 MA, 200 MA crossovers
- **Multiple symbols**: ETH, BTC, SOL, ADA, AVAX
- **Multiple timeframes**: 1m, 3m, 5m, 15m
- **Live price charts** with moving averages
- **Signal strength classification** (Strong/Medium)
- **Risk management**: Built-in stop losses and take profits
- **Pullback detection** for optimal entries

### Signal Types

- **Long Signals**: 9 EMA crosses above 21 MA
- **Short Signals**: 9 EMA crosses below 21 MA  
- **Pullback Entries**: Price near 21 MA during trends
- **Trend Confirmation**: 200 MA filter for signal strength

### Risk Management

- **Stop Loss**: 0.5% risk per trade
- **Take Profit**: 1.5% target (3:1 reward/risk ratio)
- **Position Sizing**: Based on account size and risk tolerance

### Integration Notes

- Uses same tech stack as existing dashboard (Next.js, Tailwind, Recharts)
- Simulated real-time data (replace with actual WebSocket feeds in production)
- Fully responsive design matching your existing UI
- No additional dependencies required

### Next Steps for Production

To make this production-ready, consider:

1. **Connect to real WebSocket feeds** (Binance, Bybit, etc.)
2. **Add sound/visual alerts** for new signals
3. **Position sizing calculator** integration
4. **Signal performance tracking**
5. **Export signal history** to CSV
6. **Mobile notifications** via API

The foundation is now in place - just replace the simulated data with real feeds from your preferred exchanges!
